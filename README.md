Extreme-G 2 Reimplmentation project

# Building and Contributing
You can easily run either the vs2017 or vs2019 bat file if you are on Windows and use either of those versions of Visual Studio. If you do not use Visual Studio, you may refer to the [premake5 guide](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki) for further information.

Please follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for pull requests.

# Compatibility
We will be using the Original 1999 CD Retail exe rather than the Steam release, however both version will work fine.
Please download the patched xg2pc.exe in the [patched-bins](https://github.com/BttrDrgn/ReXtremeG/tree/master/patched-bin) folder regardless of which version you are using.
The patched exe fixes some issues with operating systems from Windows XP to Windows 10.

If you do **NOT** have the Steam version and are using modern hardware, please refer to the [PCGamingWiki for Extreme-G 2](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Extreme-G_2#Rendering_glitches) regarding dgVoodoo usage.
